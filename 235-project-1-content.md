## High Concept

#### As randomly generated on [orteil.dashnet.org/gamegen](https://orteil.dashnet.org/gamegen):
> A role-playing game where you free necromancers in a fantasy world.

#### Then slightly refined:
> A role-playing autobattler where you battle increasingly powerful necromancers to free them and gain their help. In a fantasy world.
## Genre

#### Roleplaying/Autobattler/Tower Defense

The battle system is similar to that of DotA Autochess or Teamfight Tactics, but with influences from tower defense games.
The battles are framed in a roleplaying game's world, though.

## Platform

#### Web-based game, possibly mobile friendly

The primary focus of the game will be for online play, either on the website or embedded in online game portals such as Kongregate,
however, depending on the level of change required to make the game mobile-friendly, mobile play is a possibility.

## Story

In a fantasy world where necromancers are the good guys (they're just doctors who don't give up!), 
a new king rises up and begins to question the moral defensibility of just bringing people back to life whenever you want.
He has overpowered and mind controlled the necromancers and is using them to raise armies of the dead to maintain his own power.

You, a beginning necromancy student, must battle increasingly powerful necromancers to break the spell upon them and bring them
back to your side and defeat the evil king.

## Aesthetics

The graphics style will be pixelated, with low-res images with very large pixels surrounded by heavy borders, to form an
overall retro-cartoony style. The sound will match this style with a low number of instruments, simple melodies, and an overall
light feel, albeit still fitting the fantasy theme. The game will feature background music and some basic sound effects to 
add polish to combat and movement.

## Gameplay

#### Mechanics
The player has a collection of various necromancers at their disposal. In battle, necromancers summon various creatures 
from the dead which attempt to destroy the enemy necromancers and defend their own. Various summons have different power
and special abilities that must be tactically combined to form the ultimate team.

#### Control
Most action, such as managing active necromancers and conversing with NPCs, will happen with the mouse, but some actions like moving
throughout the overworld will use simple WASD controls

#### Onboarding
The onboarding process will be fairly simple. The player will be introduced to simple necromancers first, and will unlock
new ones by defeating them in combat, which will require the player to understand their abilities to some level. In addition,
the roleplaying frame for the game allows explanation of mechanics through story text.

#### Player learning
Players will improve at the game by recognizing new synergies between necromancers and understanding how to best organize and 
position them for victory.
